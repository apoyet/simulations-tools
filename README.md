# simulations-tools
This projects aims to wrap all the necessary tools for parametric simulations using codes as Sixtrack and MAD-X.


## Get started
In order to work with the simulations-tools package, please clone the project in your own machine, using SSH:

```
git clone git@github.com:apoyet/simulations-tools.git
```

Be careful to add a SSH publickey in your own machine (under ~/.ssh).

## A first example
In order to run you're first example, please run, from the main repo:
```
madx<mask/first_example.madx
```
This example will call two sequences, corresponding to the two beams in the LHC (ATS Round Optics, 30 cm, 130 urad) and will install a wire on B2. See the effect on the tune. 

You can now play with the wire installation.
